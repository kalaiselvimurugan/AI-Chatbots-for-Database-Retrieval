## Database workaround

- Create database "sample.db" 
- Create your table and schema in "sample_schema.sql" file
- Connect sqlite3 with sample_schema.sql

     ```
     sqlite3 sample.db < sample_schema.sql
     ```
- Check the connection between database and tables
    ```
    > sqlite3 sample.db
    > .tables
    > table1 table2 table3  .....
    > select * from table1;
    ```

## Sample Prompts

```markdown
FOR CHATBOT:
- "List all employees working in the HR department"
- "Add a new employee John Doe to department 2 with salary 45000"
- "Update project name to 'AI Migration' for project ID 3"
- "Delete employee with ID 105"
- "Show total salary per department"

FOR CHARTS:
- X-axis:employee_name, Y-axis:salary, chart type:Bar 
- X-axis:project_id, Y-axis:budget, chart type:Scatter
```

**Note:**
Pie Charts, the X-axis column should be categorical (like names), and the Y-axis should be numeric (like salary or budget).
Avoid using columns with lots of nulls or unrelated types (e.g., employee_id vs department_name).

## CRUD Form Sample

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.form_submit_button("Add")
with col2:
    st.form_submit_button("Clear")
```

The above layout is used across all tabs: Employees, Departments, and Projects for better UX.
